title: Methcla - Mobile audio engine
---
**Methcla** is a sound synthesis engine specially designed for mobile devices. Whether you want to write a software synthesizer for the iPad, develop an artistic application for Android phones or need an interactive soundscape for your mobile game, **Methcla** is for you!

<!-- Developed by [Stefan Kersten](http://twitter.com/kaoskorobase), longtime open source contributor ([SuperCollider](), [Faust]()) and one of the creators of the [PLAY](http://www.soundsonline.com/PLAY) sample engine, **Methcla** is the audio backend for our soundscape creation platform [hearhear.me](http://hearhear.me)

## Light-weight and flexible

**Methcla** is based on a node tree processing structure heavily inspired by [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net). Synthesis nodes are placed in a hierarchy of groups and a simple but flexible bus system allows any routing scheme imaginable. No maximum number of voices, no channel limitations.

## Designed for dynamic applications

Synths, groups and buses and can be created and controlled sample accurately through an efficient binary communication protocol that makes interfacing the engine to other languages easy. We provide bindings for **C**, **C++**, **Objective C**, **C#**, **Java** and **Haskell**.

## Flexible plugin interface

**Methcla** provides a carefully designed plugin API for synthesis, analysis and processing modules that includes features such as realtime memowry management, a worker thread pool for non-realtime tasks, robust message based communication between realtime and non-realtime contexts, and flexible logging and profiling instrumentation. Plugin modules can either be loaded dynamically at runtime on platforms that support it or linked statically. We also support DSP modules generated by the functional signal processing language [Faust](http://faust.grame.fr/), putting high-performance signal processing algorithms at your fingertips.

## Built for mobile speed

**Methcla** is specifically designed for mobile and tablet operating systems &mdash; currently we support **iOS** and **Android** with more to follow. The engine is written in portable **C++** and performance critical parts are hand-optimized using current mobile processor vector instructions.

## Available soon ...

**Methcla** is open source and available under a permissive license for use in commercial or non-commercial projects of any size. It is actively used in several of our product prototypes and we are approaching the first point release, [follow us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/methcla) for updates!
