title: Methcla - Mobile audio engine
---
<strong>Methcla</strong> is a sound synthesis engine specially designed for mobile devices. Whether you want to write a software synthesizer for the iPad, implement a loop sampler for Android phones or play back sampled and synthesized sound in your mobile game, <strong>Methcla</strong> is for you!

We are currently hacking away furiously, [stay tuned for more](http://twitter.com/samplecount)! In the meantime, you can tell us what <em>you</em> expect from a mobile audio engine by [dropping us a line](mailto:info@samplecount.com) or submitting a [feature request](https://github.com/samplecount/methcla/issues).
