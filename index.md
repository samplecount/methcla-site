**Methcla** is a sound synthesis engine specially designed for mobile devices. Whether you want to write a software synthesizer for the iPad, develop an artistic application for Android phones or need an interactive soundscape for your mobile game, **Methcla** is for you!

<!-- Developed by [Stefan Kersten](http://twitter.com/kaoskorobase), longtime open source contributor ([SuperCollider](), [Faust]()) and one of the creators of the [PLAY](http://www.soundsonline.com/PLAY) sample engine, **Methcla** is the audio backend for our soundscape creation platform [hearhear.me](http://hearhear.me)

## Light-weight and flexible

**Methcla** is based on a node tree processing structure inspired by [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net). Synthesis nodes are placed in a hierarchy of groups and a simple but flexible bus system allows any routing scheme imaginable. No maximum number of voices, no channel limitations.

## Designed for dynamic applications

Synths, groups and buses and can be created and controlled sample accurately through an efficient binary communication protocol that makes interfacing the engine to other languages easy. We provide bindings for **C**, **C++**, **Objective C** and **Haskell**.

## Embracing open standards

Synthesis and effect processing modules are written based on the extensible [LV2](http://lv2plug.in) plugin standard. We also support DSP modules generated by the digital signal processing language [Faust](http://faust.grame.fr/), putting high-performance signal processing algorithms at your fingertips.

## Built for mobile speed

**Methcla** is specifically designed for mobile and tablet operating systems &mdash; initially we are planning to support mobile devices running iOS, Android, Windows and Linux with more to follow. The engine is written in portable **C++** and performance critical parts are optimized using current mobile processor vector instructions.

## Available soon ...

**Methcla** is open source and will be released under a permissive license for use in commercial or non-commercial projects of any size. We are currently hacking away furiously, [follow us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/methcla) for updates!
